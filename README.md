Hi Everyone!

Kevin here. Until recently, I did not have a clear view of what I need to have to be a Front End Web Developer.
While waiting for potential employers to contact me, I am using my free time to study online. Still can't afford paid courses though so I make use of Lynda.com's videos and code academy and now, GitHub :)

At this stage, I'm still trying to figure out what library or framework I'm going to focus on, so I'm trying to learn and familiarize myself with most of them. Angular, Jquery, Reactjs, bootstrap just to name a few.

I enjoy hiking, eating, reading, and adding explosions to my backround using photoshop.

I look forward to learning from and working with you all.

Kevin
